A visual business card and portfolio I'm putting together for fun and profit (well, the profit remains to be determined, but it's definitely fun!)

### What is it?
A static website to give me a place to practice and show off my creative coding ideas, and list some of the projects I've been most proud to work on.  It's like a LinkedIn profile, but *interesting*.

###### I hope
