        <p class="story-title">as a child</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">my dad brought home a DOS computer with one of those black and orange monitors - he brought it home for work, but i found ways to play with it</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">we later got a Windows machine with some games - i was unsatisfied with how they played, so i learned to tweak them - i lucked out and got to take some classes in <a class="a-light" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a></p>
        <p class="story-blurb">in middle school i took a class in <a class="a-light" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> and wrote my first text-based computer game - i tried my hand at web development for the first time in high school</p>
        <p class="story-title">college and so forth</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">i went to UCSB for computer science, but never vibed with the faculty - i switched my major to Japanese Studies, earned the Mochizuki Memorial Award for academic excellence, and spent a year studying abroad in Japan, discovering myself, probably</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">after college, my professional life careened - i was a production artist, a novelist, an auto mechanic, life was hectic - i was laid off during the 2008 economic downturn and decided to give a software career another go - friends helped me get a foot in the door at the video game company they worked for</p>
        <p class="story-title">paid to write software</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">i was involved with QA, scripting, level design, and art direction - i was laid off twice and re-hired as fortunes waxed and waned - after the third layoff, i decided to gives schooling another try</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">the engineering department at CSUN did not allow students to pursue second bachelor's degrees, so I chased a master's instead - i made the dean's list, completed an extended internship in the medical devices industry, and my thesis was published and <a class="a-light" href="https://researchr.org/publication/KitzesK17">presented internationally</a></p>
        <p class="story-blurb">my first job out of school was with a bizz-tech consultancy - i traveled extensively to work with clients and did work across all manner of industries and tech stacks</p>
        <p class="story-title">priorities</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">travel and churn burned me out and i decided i wanted a more stable career path - a long time friend got me in the door at a tax reporting company</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">i wanted to advance my career, and with the help of more friends, was able to transition into a modernization role at a health insurance company, where i helped to modernize their internal tooling and build them a web development team from the ground up</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">a bit over a year later, a professional contact reached out with an offer at a start-up that excitede me both professionally and financially - i took the offer</p>
        <p class="story-title">reality</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">the start-up failed, and spectacularly - with help from yet another friend, i pivoted quickly to another start-up, which also began to teeter and soon executed layoffs</p>
        <p class="story-blurb">i now work for a third start-up, but the ship sails on calm waters for the moment - i am able to pursue personal growth while developing professionally</p>
